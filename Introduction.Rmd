**About the App**: This RShiny App is a supplement to the manuscript [Guttal, et al, 2016, PLOS ONE](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144198). In the manuscript, we applied the early warning signals of abrupt critical transitions that were developed in the ecology, climatic sciences and other complex systems literature. Those theories, based on nonlinear dynamical models, make the prediction that systems approaching a transition exhibit (a) slowed response to perturbations and (b) rising variability, thus serving as early warning signals. 

Our key result was that stock markets exhibited rising variability (as measured by variance and power-spectrum at low-frequencies of the stock market data) prior to all the financial meltdowns (including the key historical ones like 1929 Great depression, 1987 crash, 2008 great recession, etc) crashes we analyzed. However, critical slowing down, a key indicator of critical transitions, did not occur prior to any of the crashes that we analyzed.

In this simple web-app, you can apply those metrics to obtain the current trends of various stock markets (around 48 markets from the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia) in the world. We have also summarized the method and results of the manuscript for a quick reference to an interested reader.
