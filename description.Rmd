**Background**: In the manuscript  [Guttal, et al, 2016, PLOS ONE](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144198), we applied ideas of catastrophic transitions and their early warning signals to financial market data. Catastrophic transitions occur when systems are near a threshold or tipping point of a system. Another popular name for such abrupt transitions are critical transitions. 

Theories make two key predictions about systems approaching an abrupt critical transition: 

     * A slowed response to perturbations (also called critical slowing down) 
     
     * Rising fluctuations in their states

These trends occur before catastrophic transitions and hence may serve as early warning signals. The above tools were largely developed in the ecology, climatic sciences and complex systems literature and have been successfully empirically tested as well. We set out to test these predictions in a few key financial market data from the US and Europe (DJI, S&P 500, NASDAQ, FTSE and DAX).

**Key Results**: Our key results were that critical slowing down, a key indicator of critical transitions that occur near tipping points, did not occur prior to any of the crashes that we analyzed. However, stock markets exhibited rising variability (as measured by variance and power-spectrum at low-frequencies of the stock market data) prior to all the financial meltdownswe analyzed. We argued that this can be explained by strong stochasticity in financial markets that could drive a crash even when the system is far away from tipping points. 

**Historical Meltdowns** tabs show results of analysis of Dow Jones Index, S&P 500, NASDAQ, DAX (German) and FTSE (UK) markets. 

**Current Trends** tab lets you can obtain the current trends of the variability metrics (see Current Trends tab) of various stock markets from around the world (48 markets from the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia). You can choose the stock market from a drop down menu. 

**Analyze Yourself** tab lets you chose a stock market, the date, and also check how the results depend on the choice of parameter values of the length of the rolling window, bandwidth of detrending, etc.
