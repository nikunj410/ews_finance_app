**About the App**: This RShiny App is a supplement to the manuscript [Guttal, et al, 2016, PLOS ONE](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144198). 

**Background**: In the manuscript, we applied ideas of tipping points and early warning signals of critical transitions. These tools were developed in the ecology, climatic sciences and complex systems literature. Theories make two key predictions about systems approaching an abrupt transitions: They exhibit (a) slowed response to perturbations and (b) rising fluctuations in their states. These trends occur before a transitions and hence may serve as early warning signals. We set out to test these predictions to see if there are early warning signals of financial meltdowns. 

Our key result was that stock markets exhibited rising variability (as measured by variance and power-spectrum at low-frequencies of the stock market data) prior to all the financial meltdownswe analyzed.  However, critical slowing down, a key indicator of critical transitions, did not occur prior to any of the crashes that we analyzed. 

See **Historical Meltdowns** tabs for the figures to see these results.

In this simple web-app, you can obtain the current trends of the variability metrics (see Current Trends tab) of various stock markets from around the world (48 markets from the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia).
