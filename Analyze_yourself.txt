Plot (a) is the historical time series data for given stock index. The red line in the plot is the smoothened time series data for previous four years from the input date. Plot (b) is the residual time series over which we calculated our early warning signals, Variance (c) and Power Spectrum (d), using a rolling window analysis of length l_rw (see input parameters). Trends of the early warning signals are quantified using a Kendall's rank correlation coefficient calculated over a Kendall window of length l_kw (see input parameters). In these simulations we use bw = 25, l_rw = 500 days and k_rw = 250 days as default parameters.
