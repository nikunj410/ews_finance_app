Analysis of major financial crashes of S&P 500 for three major crashes of 1987, 2000 and 2008. As in the case of Dow Jones Index, autocorrelation at lag 1 does not show any clear trends, suggesting no evidence for critical slowing down prior to any of these crashes in S\&P 500. Furthermore, a strong trend of increasing variance and average power spectrum precedes all the three transitions.
