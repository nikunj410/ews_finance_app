Analysis of major financial crashes of German (DAX) and UK (FTSE) for the two major crashes of 2000 and 2008. As in the case of Dow Jones Index, autocorrelation at lag 1 does not show any clear trends, suggesting no evidence for critical slowing down prior to any of these crashes in DAX and FTSE. Furthermore, a strong trend of increasing variance and average power spectrum precedes all the three transitions.
